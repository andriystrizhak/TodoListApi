Hereâ€™s a polished `README.md` for your Todo List API application:

```markdown
# Todo List API

## Description

The Todo List API is a RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core, with a MySQL database backend. It allows users to manage todo items through a series of endpoints that support CRUD operations. The API includes Swagger for interactive documentation and NUnit/Moq for unit testing.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete todo items.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles cases where todo items are not found.
- **Swagger Integration**: Provides interactive API documentation in development mode.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes comprehensive unit tests for service and repository layers.

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- MySQL
- NUnit
- Moq
- Swagger

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version compatible with the project)
- [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (or use MySQL Docker image)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) (optional for database management)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todolistapi.git
   cd todolistapi
   ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**

   Update `appsettings.json` with your MySQL connection string:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "server=localhost;database=TodoAppDB;user=root;password=yourpassword;"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**

   Apply the Entity Framework Core migrations to set up the database schema:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

4. **Build and Run the Application**

   Build and run the application using:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The API will be available at `https://localhost:5238`.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests:

1. **Navigate to the Test Project**

   ```bash
   cd TodoListApi.Tests
   ```

2. **Run the Tests**

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## API Endpoints

- **GET /api/todo**: Retrieve all todo items.
- **GET /api/todo/{id}**: Retrieve a specific todo item by ID.
- **POST /api/todo**: Create a new todo item.
- **PUT /api/todo/{id}**: Update an existing todo item by ID.
- **DELETE /api/todo/{id}**: Delete a todo item by ID.

## Task Feedback

It was **a bit difficult** to complete the task because of a somewhere outdated model knowledges, necessity to describe whole context of task and to notify for every change I have made to code.

It took approximately **3-4 hours** to complete the task and fulfill additional requirements
 
There some problems with **config files (connection string)** and with **tests code** after generation, but in general code was fully usable.

**I faced some problems during completion of the task:**
  *Hot Reload Issues*: Problems with applying changes due to unsupported Hot Reload features, requiring manual restarts of the application.
  *Entity Framework Null Handling*: Challenges with handling null values and exceptions in EF Core methods, requiring adjustments in error handling.
  *Test Configuration*: Issues with mocking and configuring dependencies for unit tests, leading to additional setup and adjustments.
  *Code Adaptation*: Necessary modifications to auto-generated code to ensure compatibility with project requirements and existing architecture.
  *Controller Testing*: Difficulties in properly mocking and testing controller actions, including handling exceptions and ensuring accurate test outcomes.
